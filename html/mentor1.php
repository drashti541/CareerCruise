                        <p>I am a security professional with experience in audit, compliance, and sales engineering/solutions architecture. I currently work at Google Cloud as a Customer/Sales Engineer focused on Security & Compliance, where I help organizations understand and achieve cloud security. Previously, I worked at Amazon Web Services and JPMorgan Chase & Co. focused on audit and compliance with ISO 27001 and HITRUST being my primary frameworks of expertise. <br>
                        I really enjoy helping others advance their career - my own career success has been a product of an innumerable amount of people taking time to guide me. I wish to help others achieve their own level of success.</p>
